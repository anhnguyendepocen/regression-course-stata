# regression-course-stata
Stata do files from recitation notes of a 2nd semester social science statistics class

Background
---------
These do files were prepared for the Sociology 536 graduate course on Quantitative Methods in Sociology II taught by Professor Hyunjoon Park in Spring 2016. Monica King and Alex Shpenev (@shpenev) co-created these notes for the recitation labs. Feel free to use these for your own courses.

Below is the course description:

>As the second part of a two-semester sequence, this graduate course focuses on regression analysis as used in social science research. In particular, we discuss features and assumptions of linear regression and logistic regression models. We learn how to apply regression models to real social science data using Stata and how to interpret the results.

Requirements
---------
- Stata

Data requirements:

**NOTE:** Some of the data linked to the UCLA stats sample datasets are broken. We are in the process of fixing these bugs. 

- Only the "titanic12.dta" file needs to be downloaded and saved in your directory. We provide links to other datasets or use "input" to read in simple data. All data for this course are "small". 

File Descriptions
--------
- **Recitation 1:** t-tests
- **Recitation 2:** test of proportions and chi-squared
- **Recitation 3:** data cleaning and introduction to bivariate regression
- **Recitation 4:** bivariate regression with variable transformation and dummy variables
- **Recitation 5:** multiple regression with categorical and continuous predictors
- **Recitation 6:** multiple regression with interactions
- **Recitation 7:** logistic regression introduction
- **Recitation 8:** logistic regression model comparison, odds ratios
- **Recitation 9:** logistic regression with interactions
- **Recitation 10:** multinomial logistic regression 
- **Recitation 11:** continued from previous do file with model comparison
